# 17.2 Statistics of Sampling Distributions

## Reading

## Lesson
In lesson 17.1, we saw that if we take a large enough samples to from a sampling distribution, we form a normal distribution.

Now, we need to talk about the exact shape of the normal distribution. Let's consider a new dataset. Am individual's intelligence is measured in America using the IQ test. The distribution has a population mean of 100 ($\mu = 100$) and a standard deviation of 15 ($\sigma = 15$).

Your company collects 10,000 sample averages of people's IQ scores. In the following figures, I show the sampling distributions indicated with the blue histogram and the normal distribution of the samples (red curve). I also show the normal distribution for the population (green curve). The figures show the distributions for sample sizes of 10, 25, 50, and 100.

![Sampling Distributions compared to normal distributions of the population](https://github.com/drolsonmi/SnowCollegeClasses/blob/main/math1040online/images/Fig17_2a_sampling_distributions.png?raw=true)

Notice how the mean for the population and the samples are the same. So, 
$$\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$$

However, the normal distributions become narrower (they have smaller standard deviations). Let's compare the standard deviations of the two normal distributions. 

When the sample size is n = 10, the standard deviation is $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = 4.748$. If we take the ratio of the standard deviations, 
$$\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}} = \frac{15}{4.748} = 3.159$$

At first this doesn't look very helpful. However, when we see that $\sqrt{10}=3.162$, then we have a possible connection! Let's see if this works for our other sample sizes.

| Sample Size ($n$) | $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ | $\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}$ | $\sqrt{n}$ |
| :---: | :---:|:---:|:---:|
| 10  | 4.748 |  3.159 | 3.162 |
| 25  | 3.012 |  4.980 | 5     |
| 50  | 2.117 |  7.085 | 7.071 |
| 100 | 1.494 | 10.040 | 10    |

The last two columns are the ones we want to look at. The second-to-last column is the ratio of standard deviations, and the last column is $\sqrt{n}$. And they are very close! If the number of samples increases, then the two values will get closer and closer.

So, it holds! We now have a relationship between the population and sampling standard deviations. 
$$\sqrt{n} = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}} \qquad \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

At this point, we can use our normal distribution to calculate probabilities as we did in Lessons 15 and 16.

### Application
You administer a specialized Competency Exam. The exam takes an average of 45 minutes to complete with a standard deviation of 12 minutes.

You are asked to administer the exam in an area that you suspect will complete the exam in less than 42 minutes.
* What is the probability that one single student completes the exam in less than 42 minutes?

$$\mu = 45 \qquad \sigma = 12$$
![Normal Distribution of population](https://github.com/drolsonmi/SnowCollegeClasses/blob/main/math1040online/images/Fig17_2b_Example_PopulationNormal.png?raw=true)

$$z = \frac{42-45}{12} = \frac{-3}{12} = -0.25$$
$$P(t \le 42) = P(z \le -0.25) = 0.401 = \mathbf{40.1\%}$$

Now, instead of looking at just one student, you're going to sample 30 students. Because of this, we expect a higher probability the average is closer to the mean, and a lower probability of an extreme value.
* What is the probability that the average time for your sample of 50 students is less than 42 minutes?

$$\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu = 45 \qquad \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{30}} = \frac{12}{5.477} = 2.191$$

![Normal Distribution of sample](https://github.com/drolsonmi/SnowCollegeClasses/blob/main/math1040online/images/Fig17_2c_Example_SamplingNormal.png?raw=true)

$$z = \frac{42-45}{2.191} = \frac{-3}{2.191} = -1.369$$
$$P(t \le 42) = P(z \le -1.369) = 0.085 = \mathbf{8.5\%}$$

So, we see a much higher probability for a single individual, but a much lower probability for a group average.
